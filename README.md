# Methane Budget
Sankey diagrams that visualize 2003&ndash;2012 methane (CH4) emissions data collected by [Saunois et al.](http://www.earth-syst-sci-data-discuss.net/essd-2016-25/) in 14 world regions for key sources, in both "top down" (TD) and "bottom up" (BU) approaches. The global CH4 budget for TD and BU is estimated at 558 [540–568] and 736 [596–884] Tg CH4 yr-1, respectively. Larger global estimates from BU are mostly due to larger natural emissions from e.g. inland waters, wetlands and geological sources, but it is likely that some of these individual emssions are over-estimated.
